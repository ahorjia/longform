It is muddleheaded to say, Iam in favor
of this kind of political regime rather
than that: what one reaUy means is, I
prefer this kind of police.

uring the first weeks of the autumn election campaigns I noticedthat when I turned on the radio andheard three or four people talkingabout politics, I couldn't tell the difference between the show's host, thecongressman who had dropped by todrum up votes, the caller in Worcester disgusted with welfare cheats, andthe caller in San Diego who wantedto bomb Baghdad. By late OctoberI understood that the distinctionsdidn't matter. Everybody was as angry as everybody else, and all presentbelonged to one or another of theparties of virtue and conscience. Asoften as not the host turned out to bea friend of Pat Robertson's, thecallers-Della in Worcester and Bobin San Diego-had both learnedtheir politics from the paintings ofNorman Rockwell, and the candidate, although he had served in Congress for twelve years, miraculouslyhad avoided the sloughs of corruption that had engulfed so many of hisfellow pilgrims on Capitol Hill.Once having established their various states of innocence, the guestspro.ceeded to the great task of callingdown the wrath of Moses or TeddyRoosevelt on the heads of their innumerable enemies. The catalogue oftheir resentment provided the textfor most of the season's five hundredelection campaigns, and well beforethe end of September the angryvoices on the radio had become indistinguishable from the televisioncommercials in which the candidatesfor federal, state, and municipal office-like schoolboys delighting inthe hate speech so long forbidden inthe universities-scrawled dirty6 HARPER'S MAGAZNE/jANUARY 1995Thunder on the rightBy Lewis H. Laphamwords on a succession of blackboardsfor which they paid, in the majormedia markets, as much as $70,000 aminute. Campaigning for the Senatein Tennessee, the Republican candidate (a heart surgeon named BillFrist with little to recommend himother than the magnificence of hisinherited fortune) demanded "termlimits for career politicians and thedeath penalty for career criminals."Running for governor in Florida, [ebBush, the son of the former president, indirectly charged the Democratic incumbent with murder; andin New York State the Republicancandidate for comptroller, HerbertLondon, portrayed his opponent as ablack racist likely to favor sendingJews to death camps.Every now and then I made note ofa remark that embodied the spirit ofthe campaign, and among these [ findtwo that strike me as memorable.First, from Cal Thomas, a syndicatednewspaper columnist with whom Ifound myself in conversation on CSpan almost a year before the election. Summing up the already prevalent feeling of revulsion for thefederal government and all its smilinglies, Thomas said, "We ought to justput a full-body condom over the entire city of Washington and flush itout to sea." Second, on the last weekend of the campaign, CongressmanNewt Gingrich of Georgia (nowSpeaker of the House of Representatives) fitting the news of tragic murder in South Carolina to the specifications of self-servingpolitical slogan.Taking note of the arrest of SusanSmith, the woman who drowned hertwo small children in a lake, Gingrich attributed her crime to theswarm of evils let loose upon the landby left-wing English professors and aprolonged Democratic majority inCongress. The poor woman's confusion, he said, "vividly reminds everyAmerican how sick the society is getting and how much we have to havechange ... [and] the only way you getchange isto vote Republican."The bitter slanders reflected aperception current among the propertied classes, predominantly whiteand suburban, that they were beingrobbed of their birthrights by a feckless government allied with thearmies of the urban poor. Togetherwith the citizens calling in theircomplaints to Don Imus or RushLimbaugh-Della from her successful boutique and Bob from his profitable boat marina-even politicalcandidates who had grown old inpublic office presented themselvesas victims of a world they nevermade (one that had arisen mysteriously out of the mists of the 1960sbehind the lyrics of a Bob Dylansong), and they gladly confirmedeverybody's fondest fears of classwarfare between the haves and thehave-nets. Few politicians put thepoint so bluntly, but they knewwhich side to choose and, whetherDemocrat or Republican, they tooktheir uncompromising stands-boldas eagles, brave as lions-s-under thebeach umbrellas of theObig money.n November 8 the sum of theelectorate's well-nourished grievancesfound expression in the vote thatsince has become the revelation ofthe reactionary dream of paradise regained. Fat the first time in forty yearsthe Republican Party gained command of the House of Representatives; together with a majority in theSenate, the party's candidates won gubernatorial elections in California,Texas, Pennsylvania, and New Yorkaswell ascontrol of eighteen state legislatures previously held by the Democrats. On the Democratic side of theballot incumbent officeholders felllike rotted pears from wind-stricken
trees, but among the Republicans not
one sitting governor, senator, or congressmanlost an election.Understood as a popular referendum against what since 1964 hasbeen variously known as the GreatSociety, the New Covenant, and the"L" word, the vote announced theloss of belief in the proposition thatgovernment, any government, cancall into being the virtues of a civilsociety or the energies of high civilization. The vote matched the temper of a season in which the lateRichard Herrnstein and CharlesMurray's book The Betl Curve, apatchwork of dubious statistics andbogus theory, became a best-sellingsensation on the strength of its goodnews that destiny was genetic, cognition hereditary, and most black people justly sentenced at birth to livesof poverty and crime.The post-election sifting of thevote confirmed the pre-election impression of panic among the possessing classes-for the first time since1970 more votes were cast by Republicans than by Democrats; in at leasthalf of the six hundred elections tonational, state, and local office, thewhippers-in of the Christian rightherded the faithful to the camp of thevictorious Republican candidate, andin California, Proposition 187 (theone denying money and governmentservices to illegal aliens) carried by amargin of 3 to 2.As was to be expected, the grandmasters of the Republican fraternallodges read the entrails of the election as proof of a happy return to theaesthetics of Cecil B. De Mille andthe politics of Calvin Coolidge. Butalthough I could understand the rejoicing on the right as a euphoria notunlike the rapture of the deep, I expect that among the general publicthe feeling will prove short-lived,like the excitements associated withthe smashing of champagne glassesand the tearing down of goalposts.Maybe it is unreasonable to ask orexpect anything else of an election inwhich only 39 percent of those eligible bothered to go to the polls and 75percent of the voters didn't know thenames of their own representatives inCongress. Closely trimmed to thewinds of rumor drifting through theheadphones of the radio talk showhosts, the campaign gathered itsemotional force from a series of imbecile non sequiturs cheerfully ignored by Della and Bob as well as bythe celebrity host and the distinguished senator. As follows:1. Populism in CreamMuch of the present unhappinessin the society, as well as most of thedamage done to the nation's economyover the last fifteen years, descendsfrom the Reagan Administration'spolicy of increasing the wealth of therich and reducing the means of thepoor. Given the ceaseless mutteringduring the campaign about the lack ofmoney and the loss of jobs. the electorate, had it been interested in causeand effect, might have been expectedto direct its anger against the marblefacades of the American oligarchyagainst the Federal Reserve that hasbeen steadily raising the interest rate(five times in the nine months priorto the election) or the corporationsthat have been busily winnowing therows of middle management or shipping their back offices to Malaysia.But instead of blaming the rich, thevoters blamed the poor, venting theirspleen on immigrants, criminals,racial minorities, and beggars-Le., onthe constituencies that can't afford atrade association or a high-priced lobbyist. The tone of the political advertisements aped the snide humor of theDavid Letterman show, the insultsand put-downs-s-fatso, zit, liberal,wetback, etc.-meant to display themoral refinement of the politicianpaying for the jokes. The candidatesmade sport of poor people buyingshrimp with food stamps; they saidnothing about Wall Street speculatorsbuying office buildings with tax-freejunk bonds.Several of the nation's leadingnewspaper columnists were at painsto point out that the trouble with thepolitical season-its mean-spiritedness and absence of debate-followed from the country's straitenedeconomic circumstances. The Godfearing American people were said tobe out of money and out of compassion, feeling themselves under attackby tax collectors stealing their moneyand dark-skinned immigrants stealing their jobs.But little about the election campaigns suggested that they were anything other than expensive entertainments presented at the pleasureof the rich for the amusement oftheir admirers among the would-berich, a series of diversions on the order of the amateur theatricals stagedby the particular friends of MarieAntoinette at the Petite Trianon.The prominent candidates were forthe most part individuals possessedofsizable fortunes (Mitt Romney, TedKennedy, Frank Lautenberg, MichaelHuffington, [eb and George Bush,Herb Kohl, Richard Fisher, and BillFrist, etc.), and the audience towhich they addressed their remarkswas made up largely of the news media (Le., the claque employed by theoligarchy to applaud its comings inand goings out) and those voters belonging to the wealthier echelons ofthe middle class. Far from being toopoor to support its enthusiasm forpolitics, the country apparently wasprosperous enough to spend upwardof $500 million on the staging of anevent that ESPN might rate as an attraction comparable to the EastAsian golf tour or a wood-choppingtournament.2. The Prom King1 can't remember a campaign inwhich so many people expressed suchviolent feelings of disgust for a sittingpresident. The objections were seldom political. Instead of condemningClinton's legislative proposals or theories of government, the critics complained of the flaws in his characterand deportment. They wished that hewouldn't give so many speeches or eatso many cheeseburgers. They didn'tlike his wife, or the sound of hisvoice, or the look of his hair. Theythought him weak or too much obsessed by bureaucracy. Republicancandidates everywhere in the countrysought to identify their opponents asFriends of Bill, as if by merely establishing the association they provedthe Democrat guilty of a dingy passion for government acronyms orGennifer Flowers.The perceptions were contradictedby the facts. Clinton shaped his poliNOTEBOOK 7tics to the conservative temperament
of the times, and no Democratic
president in recent memory had so
eagerly attempted to expose himself
as a closet Republican. During the
1992 campaign Clinton avoided being too often seen in the company offeminists and black people, and asPresident he had lobbied into lawthe three Republican initiatives dearto the heart of President Bushdeficit reduction, the crime bill, andthe North American Free TradeAgreement. His economic policieswere as sound as the furniture in theboardroom of Goldman Sachs, buthe made the mistake of thinking thatthe country was still interested inDemocratic social policy, and by attempting to reform the health-caresystem he smeared his image as agood Republican and became thepersonification of big government,the inveterate busybody rummagingthrough desks and insurance claims,levying taxes and stamping deathcertificates.Once having blundered into themorass of large-scale social reform,the President never could regain hisfooting as the Prom King elected topreside over what in 1992 both thevoters and Clinton's corporate sponsors thought would prove to be a Republican government dressed up inthe costumes of a television miniseries loosely based on the life ofAndrew Jackson. The DemocraticParty had been morally and intellectually bankrupt for twenty years, theremnants of its principles sold atauction at increasingly low pricesduring the Reagan and Bush administrations, and nobody expectedClinton to take seriously the slogansfound on old Hubert Humphrey buttons. Most of the time he didn't, butonce or twice he forgot who was paying for the orchestra, and despite hisinnate conservatism and fondnessfor golf, the political audience choseto see him as a lost flower child at aGrateful Dead concert.3. Uncle SugarSo many of the opinion pollsshowed the electorate so implacablyopposed to the existence as well asthe theory of big government thatone would have thought at least a few8 HARPER'S MAGAZINE I JANUARY 1995voters willing to give up their ownparticular subsidy-the tax deductionfor home loan mortgages, say, or Social Security payments, or studentloans, or Medicare. Della and Bob remained silent on the subject, and sodid the candidates touring states andtowns dependent upon the militarybudget or posing for photo opportunities in picturesque wheat fields enriched with the fertilizer of federalmoney. The damnable entitlementalways proved to be somebody else'sentitlement-somebody certainly undeserving and probably ethnic.About the uses of government thecontradictions were so many and soblatant that even RepresentativeGingrich often got lost in thelabyrinth of his own sophism. He objected to the reckless squandering ofpublic money on the shiftless andungrateful poor, but he favored extravagant transfer payments to theappreciative and industrious rich,and over the span of his fifteen yearsin Congress his own districts inGeorgia received gifts of federallargesse almost as lavish as those sentto Arlington County, Virginia, andBrevard County, Florida.Nor was Gingrich willing to relinquish the government's power tobuild the new Arcadia or justifyGod's ways to man. The Democratsupon whom Gingrich dripped theacid of his contempt ("welfare liberals," "McGoverniks," "Stalinists,""enernjies] of normal Americans")had made the mistake of trying to reconstruct the social and economicorder. Presuming to change blackpeople into white people and Spanish Harlem into Palm Springs, theyhad sought to rectify the mistakes ofa careless Providence that somehowhad neglected to provide equalshares of intelligence, beauty, andMicrosoft Preferred to every childborn under the American sun.In the world according to Newt,the proposition failed not only because it was foolish but also becauseit substituted the lesser for thegreater task. What was really important was the reconstruction of themoral order, nothing less than the"rescue of American civilization"from the pits of cynicism and despairinto which it had been cast by hardened feminists and marijuana-smoking guitar players. The government,said Gingrich, must bring forth thespiritual analogue of the New Deal,must repeal the decade of the 1960s,clarify the distinctions between rightand wrong, take Sunday school attendance, recall the American people (if necessary by force) to theshelter of "traditional morals," andbend the coercive powers of government to the reformation of theAmerican character instead of thereconstruction of the Americaneconomy.4. Past PerfectNo day passed without one or another of the candidates saying that"it's time for a change." The phraseappeared in eight of every ten television commercials, the implicationbeing that whoever bought the timewas advancing boldly into a futurecertain to be filled with prizes likethe ones handed out by VannaWhite on Wheel of Fortune. But thephrase was as empty as every otherphrase in the campaign. What waswanted was the appearance ofchange and not its substance: a parade of new faces, even if they wereas vacant as glass (c.f., George Pataki, the governor of New York), and arush of new words, even if they werenonsense rhymes.Had either the voters or the candidates seriously considered theprospect of substantive change, theconversation presumably would haveaddressed specific legislative measures-about education, foreign policy, the deficit, health care, theGAIT treaty, campaign finance, andthe environment. But instead ofmodest and therefore plausible reforms, there was Gingrich's grandiose"Contract with America," and instead of debate there was gossipabout Oliver North's felonies orChuck Robb's mistress, about "MeGoverniks" wandering in and out ofpornographic movies, about themoral decay in downtown Toledoand drug dealers scouting the perimeter of Greenwich, Connecticut.By way of allaying every voter'sworry that he or she may have togive something up, the candidatesnew to politics put forward their ig--------------------------------- ...•,-----------------norance of Washington as proof thatthey were the last people on earthlikely to know how to operate themachinery of government and thus,by definition, incapable of changingeven so much as a light bulb in theHouse of Representatives. It was as ifa heart surgeon were to say that although he knew nothing of scalpelsor anesthetics, and objected to thearbitrary discrimination between anartery and a vein, he was the man toperform the operation because hehad adhered all his life to "Hoosierhometown values" and once hadsaved an Airedale from being runover by a train. Elect me, dear voter,because I am an ignorant fool. Evenbetter, dear voter, elect me because,like you, I despise the office in pursuit of which I already have spent$24 million in promotional fees.Campaigning for the Senate inCalifornia, Michael Huffington setthe standard of absurdity to which somany of the season's campaigns soexpensively aspired. With respect tohis presence in Washington as a oneterm congressman during the ReaganAdministration, Huffington said thatall anybody did there waspass aroundunintelligible pieces of paper, a charade in which he for one certainlymeant to take no part. "I'm againstWashington," he said, "always havebeen. Congress has been in sessionfor two hundred years, andrJ"" all they do is make laws."~aken as a measure of the popular and deep-seated preference forthe joys of anti-politics, the belligerent non sequiturs of the fall electionsall but guarantee another two yearsof legislative futility in Congress,which probably is the result that thevoters had in mind. Gingrich confirmed the prognosis when he cameto Washington three days after theelection and said that as the probableSpeaker of the House he was in nomood to bargain with anybody whodidn't agree with his notions ofAmerica's moral reawakening.Speaking to a crowd of businessmenat the Willard Hotel, Gingrich offered his intransigence ("cooperation, yes; compromise, no") as a testament to his righteousness, and to areporter from the New York Times hesaid, "The White House can eitherdecide to accommodate reality, orthey can decide to repudiate reality.That's their choice."Absent the prospect of useful compromise, and assuming that the newRepublican majorities won't takemuch interest in President Clinton's"national conversation" or HillaryClinton's "politics of meaning," whatthen will the members of the 104thCongress find to say to one another?Let the majority divide into the factions of the authoritarian and libertarian right, and with any luck it willfall to arguing about how best to closethe Mexican border, or whether tosend troublesome adolescents to bootcamps or Indian reservations, orwhen to schedule public floggingsand where to build the next prison, orwhich grade of boiling oil to pour onthe heads of undocumented maids.Given the presumption that government can contribute nothing of importance to the building of a secularcommonwealth, what else can it doexcept distribute punishments anddevise spectacles likely to excite theinterest of a bored audience at thenext election? It won't be easy to upstage the sensations of 1994. Possiblythe congressmen will content themselves with the frequent openings oforphanages (loud applause whenGingrich cuts the ribbon), or withthe ceremonial demolitions of federaloffice buildings (more applause and arelease of balloons), or with costumeballs staged in the courtyards of stateprisons (dance music, the laughter ofpretty women, Oliver North and PatBuchanan both dressed as Napoleon).But the market for mass entertainment favors the trend toward violence, and in response to the clamorof the opinion polls I can imagine aparty of committee chairmen outfitted by Banana Republic or PoloSport, gunning for an endangeredspecies of jackrabbit or Guatemalanon the Texas plains. _Photo by Kalhy MorrisDeparturesJennifer C Cornell"These are stories that succeed without last-minute revelations or authorialsumming up, that seem to contain the heart of each story not in some singleline or climactic scene, but in every careful sentence along the way,so that thefinal image alwaysappears to be both inevitable and inspired."-Alice McDermottCloth $22.50University of Pittsburgh PressTo order: CUP Services,Box 6525, Ithaca, NY 14851 (1-800-666-2211)NOTEBOOK 9
